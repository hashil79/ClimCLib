5/6/2016:Preparing Version 1.2 Release
================================
TODO:
		1. Graphics (HUGE ADDITION)
			a. Create a window content with one function
				i. Window should contain a char * Title, Vec2u Size , and maybe a context to draw on?
			b. Create a basic 2D renderer that can do things like draw lines, shapes, textures



	Finished:
		1. Matricies
		2. more vector functions

Current Status:
	30% till 1.2 Release


1/23/2016: Version 0.1
================================
TODO:
	1. Implement more Abstract Data-Types such as:
		a. Trees
			i. Maybe implement one with just left-right nodes
			   and implement another with a pointer to the parent
			   as well
		b. Associative array [Semi implemented]
			i. Maybe have a structure called a cell with a string
			   as the key, and a pointer to any data type as a value
		c. Circular Lists
			i. Just implement the singly and doubly lists with a
			   a pointer to the head node, once next == NULL, set
			   next == headNode
		d. Matricies
			i. Implement Mat2, Mat3,Mat4

	2. Implement more Vector Functions
			i. Lerp, Slerp, Normalize, etc..

	Version 1.2



	To Build:
		This is a compiler-dependant project, in
	to build, you must run make all and it will be built
	to your default compiler (To use a different one, just
	use make all CC=compilerOfChoice).
		To get future updates, read the TODO file.  I also
	include a tests folder, which i have one file called
	test.  You can use this to test your current build and
	its capabilities.  just run make all and then make test and
	you will have a Test1 executable. In a linux enviornment, you
	just need to run ./Test1 to run it.
